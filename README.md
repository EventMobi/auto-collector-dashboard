# Keen IO Auto-Collector Dashboard ðŸ“‰ðŸ“ŠðŸ“ˆ

A pre-made dashboard for Keen IO projects using the [Auto-Collector](https://keen.io/docs/streams/web-auto-collection/?source=glitch).

This dashboard is built using the existing event data models, so you don't have to!

You can remix the project to make it your own in Glitch with your own Keen IO data here:

[![Remix on Glitch](https://cdn.glitch.com/2703baf2-b643-4da7-ab91-7ee2a2d00b5b%2Fremix-button.svg)](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/auto-collector-dashboard)

## Getting Started 

To get started, you need:
- A [Keen IO account](https://keen.io/signup?source=glitch)
- A Keen IO project with data streaming to it from the [Auto-Collector](https://keen.io/docs/streams/web-auto-collection/?source=glitch)

Once you have these two things, you can remix the code in [Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/auto-collector-dashboard) or locally by pulling the [Glitch branch](https://github.com/keen/auto-collector-dashboard/tree/glitch) of this repo.

Next, you need to replace the example `projectId` and `readKey` in the public/settings.js file with those for your project. 

You can also choose what the relative timeframe your dashboard queries. We have set it at `this_4_weeks` in settings.js to start. 

## Running the Application

If you are **running the project within Glitch**, all you have to do now is click the "Show Live" button at the top. 

If you are **running the project locally**, you need to set what locahost:`PORT` you would like to view the dashboard on. You can set the environment variable locally by creating an *.env file located in the same folder as server.js. Here's an example *.env file:

`PORT=3000`

Given you already have [node installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your machine, you will then run `node server.js` in your terminal in the same folder as server.js. 

You can then navigate to localhost:3000 (or whatever `PORT` you set) in your browser to see the dashboard. 

Your dashboard should then render! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ“Šâœ¨

## Going Forward 

The cool thing about the Auto-Collector is that it is just a start.

You can add your own custom data visualizations and analysis for your Keen IO event streams alongside the event data models from the Auto-Collector. 

If you want to track custom events beyond pageviews, clicks, and form submissions, you can easily access our core Javascript tracking library (which this SDK uses under the hood). See more [here](https://keen.io/docs/streams/web-auto-collection/?source=glitch).

The data collected by the Auto-Collector nicely compliments other user behavior data. For example: You could have a graph of `signup` or `login` events that are custom to your application. Other example actions you could track with Keen IO are: `swipes`, `upgrades`, `purchases`, `powerups`, `errors`, `shares`.
